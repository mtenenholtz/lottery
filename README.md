# lottery
Smart contract functioning as a lottery, running on Rinkeby. If you want to play with this yourself, put your twelve
word mnemonic in the `deploy.js` file.

# Usage
From the root directory, run `node deploy.js`. This will compile and deploy your contract to the Rinkeby testnet. The
console will return the deployed contract's address, as well as it's full ABI. Make note of these for use in your 
front-end applications.
